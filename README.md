# Sonarleaks

## Summary

SonarCloud is a SAST SaaS platform built onto SonarQube.

During my DevSecOps journey, I recently discovered that [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) (From SonarSource) offers the possibility to explore public projects.
After working on [Postleaks](https://github.com/cosad3s/postleaks) and popularity of some other similars projects (like [swaggerHole](https://github.com/Liodeus/swaggerHole)) related to public data on SaaS, the `Explore` button triggers my curiosity.

I created this small tool to get basic infos about Sonarcloud projects from the `Explore` tab. Some of them **are from private source repository, or can be related to a company which misconfigured the repository visibility**.  
**It becomes juicy when the results provides the source code AND the static analysis.**
